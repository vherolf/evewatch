Prototype of an asyncio python based eveonline chat log file parser 


## features 

* automatically finds your chat files
* parses all chatlogs asynchronously from today that you define in a list 
* can search for chars or systems (or anything you want) in chat messages
* can send mqtt messages if something is found 


## nice to have

* current pilot position
* automatically find surrounding systems within a jump range
